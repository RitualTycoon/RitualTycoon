    <div style="max-width: 500px;margin:auto">To live on the island Maj Emag mayor Harvey spoke to his people that they
         have to sacrifice their crops and animals to the vulcano god Labolg, whenever
         he asks for them. Labolg will be satisfied when you give him your harvest but if you won't,
         he gets angry and will bring the eruption of the vulcano and so pain and misfortune will overcome the island.</div>
